It is a four-wheeled robot, which can relocate from one place to the other, where you can control through a hand gesture. In the hand gesture we are going to use a glove which consists of certain features:
- A 6DOF IMU controlled through a Nano Arduino.
- The robotic arm has the features of:
•	Obstacle detection by Infrared sensor
•	A fire detection through a flame sensor where when any fire is detected a vibrator in the gloves works to warn the user
•	Bluetooth module sends signal from the glove to the arm to communicate with each other.
•	A kill switch button so that when an error occur the user presses the switch and the whole system is shut down.
